## Pattern

The `<Pattern/>` component creates specific patterns using gradient styles.
These patterns are designed to be joined together with panels to add decorative
detail. These patterns do not visualy resemble traditional gradients. The
component is used more as a separator between sections, transitioning from the
panel background to the page background. While these patterns are not
configurable, they can be selected from a list of predefined pattern names,
offering a variety of visual styles to enhance the page design.
