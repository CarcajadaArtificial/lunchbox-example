## Revealer

The `<Revealer/>` component is an interactive island designed to show or hide
its content based on user interaction. It uses an actuator element, such as a
button or link, to control the visibility of its children. By default, the
content remains hidden until the actuator is activated, providing a clean and
dynamic user experience. This component is perfect for creating expandable
sections, modals, or tooltips within your layout. You can customize the actuator
through the `actuator` prop and manage additional properties with the `fwd`
attribute.
