# Layout

The `<Layout/>` component serves as the container for `<Module/>` components,
establishing the foundational grid system for your page. It employs a 12-column
grid to organize content, which gracefully adjusts to a 6-column "half-size"
grid on screens narrower than 40em. This design ensures your layout remains
responsive across various devices. You have the option to include or exclude
horizontal whitespace in your layout. Opting out of whitespace creates a
dashboard-like feel, perfect for data-heavy interfaces, while including
whitespace gives your page an article-like aesthetic that's ideal for
content-rich experiences.
