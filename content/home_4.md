Now, let's talk about the core text elements that bring clarity and functionality to our pages: the `<Text/>`, `<Code/>`, `<Kbd/>`, `<Time/>`, and `<Link/>` components.

The `<Text/>` component is your standard bearer, delivering clean, readable text for any content, `<Code/>` highlights snippets of code with precision, making it clear and distinct, and `<Kbd/>` showcases keyboard inputs, giving them a polished, distinct appearance.

The `<Time/>` component elegantly displays dates and times, adding temporal context to your content. Lastly, the `<Link/>`component connects the dots, creating seamless navigation and interactive connections within and beyond your page.

These components together form the backbone of textual communication in our design, each playing a vital role in enhancing readability and user interaction.
