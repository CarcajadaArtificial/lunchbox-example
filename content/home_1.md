## Page components

Welcome to our test page, where the ordinary meets the extraordinary. Here, we
explore the core of our creation, where web elements come together in a blend of
code and style. First, let’s introduce the main components. The `<Main/>`,
`<Header/>`, `<Footer/>`, `<Layout/>`, and `<Navigation/>` are the backbone of
our digital space. They bring structure and organization to our website. For
now, they stand ready for detailed examination in the pages ahead. Get ready for
the journey. This is just the start. As we proceed, you’ll see these elements
thoroughly tested and examined.

## Panel

The `<Panel/>` component is essential. It serves as the foundation for many of
our designs. Think of it as a blank canvas that stands out against the rest of
the page. Within its borders, other components find their place and function.
This is more than just a background; it’s the stage where the modules of our
interface come to life. It’s a key part of our design and functionality.
Understanding this component is crucial to using this library effectively.
