## Components

### Page components

Welcome to the wild frontier of our test page, a place where the ordinary collides head-on with the extraordinary. Here, we dive into the heart of our creation, where the blood and bones of the web come together in a raucous symphony of code and style. First up, let’s meet the heavy hitters of our lineup. 

The `<Main/>`, `<Header/>`, `<Footer/>`, `<Layout/>`, and `<Navigation/>`, these are not just components, they are the backbone of our digital domain. They hold the line, keep the chaos at bay, and bring structure to our online universe. But don’t get too attached, because their true trial by fire is set for another stage. For now, they stand tall, waiting for the relentless scrutiny that awaits them in the pages to come.


So, strap in and prepare for the journey. This is just the beginning. The deeper we go, the more you’ll see these elements tested, twisted, and turned inside out.


### Panel

This is the heart of the storm, where the `<Panel/>` component reigns supreme. This is no ordinary piece of the puzzle; it's the foundation upon which many of our wildest creations are built. Picture it as a canvas, a bold expanse of contrasting color that stands out against the mundane backdrop of the page.

Here, in the realm of the `<Panel/>`, the magic happens. It's a space defined not by its boundaries, but by its potential. Within its vibrant borders, other components find their place, their purpose. This is where the action unfolds, where the story of our digital tapestry begins.

The `<Panel/>` is not just a background, it’s the stage for our drama, the ground upon which the cast of characters—buttons, cards, forms—come to life. It’s the unsung hero, the silent partner in this dance of design and functionality. So, pay attention, because understanding the `<Panel/>` is key to unlocking the true power of our component library.
