## Button

Our `<Button/>` component is a straightforward extension of the standard HTML
button element. It offers various "type" options like "default", "disabled",
"error", "panel", and "transparent" to suit different use cases. You can also
adjust the "padding" with options like "default", "large", and "compact" to fit
your design needs.
