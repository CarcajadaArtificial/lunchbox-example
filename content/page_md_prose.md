# Design Revolution

### Introduction

In the world of **web development**, creating websites that are both _highly
configurable_ and _accessible_ is paramount. Embracing **good HTML practices**
ensures a foundation that is robust and scalable. This manifesto champions a
**theme-centered** approach, leveraging **CSS variables** while deliberately
avoiding the use of frameworks like **Tailwind CSS**.

## Section 1

A **responsive** design ethos is essential in the modern digital landscape. By
prioritizing **dark mode** as the default, we acknowledge the growing preference
for user interfaces that are easy on the eyes, particularly in low-light
environments. Moreover, this approach not only enhances usability but also
aligns with **energy-saving** practices.

The **power of CSS variables** cannot be understated. They offer a _centralized_
way to manage and customize styles across an entire project, ensuring
consistency and ease of maintenance. For instance, defining a primary color as
`--primary-color: #3498db;` allows for effortless updates and theme adjustments
without redundant code changes.

## Section 2

**Avoiding Tailwind CSS** is a conscious decision to promote clarity and
simplicity.

### Section 2.1

While Tailwind offers utility classes, our philosophy prioritizes semantic HTML
and _meaningful_ class names that **improve readability** and
**maintainability**. Inline-code blocks like `class="btn-primary"` are intuitive
and convey purpose without the overhead of memorizing countless utility classes.

### Section 2.2

Ultimately, a **dark-mode-first** design approach combined with a commitment to
**good HTML practices** and **CSS variables** ensures a **scalable**,
**maintainable**, and **user-friendly** web experience. Embrace the revolution
and craft websites that stand the test of time.
