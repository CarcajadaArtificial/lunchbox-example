## Loader

The `<Loader/>` component is designed to manage the display of content based on
loading status. When the content is not yet loaded, it shows an animated loading
icon to indicate that the process is ongoing. Once the content is loaded, the
`<Loader/>` renders its children, seamlessly transitioning from the loading
state to the fully loaded content.

This component is essential for improving user experience by providing visual
feedback during content loading, ensuring users are aware that the page is
actively processing and will display the desired information shortly.
