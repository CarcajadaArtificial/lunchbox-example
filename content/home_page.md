## Page components

In addition to `<Header/>`, we have `<Navigation/>`, `<Main/>`, and `<Footer/>`
components. These are designed to be used no more than once per page, ensuring
your layouts stay clean and semantic. They're standardized extensions of the
proper HTML elements you'd typically use. For maintaining grid and responsive
visual consistency throughout your page, you can use the `<Layout/>` and
`<Module/>` components multiple times as needed.
