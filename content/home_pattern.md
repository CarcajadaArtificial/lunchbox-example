## Pattern

The `<Pattern/>` component is a unique take on using CSS gradients. Instead of
typical gradient effects, it creates solid, repeating patterns that can add
interesting edges to your elements. Inspired by designs found online, we've
developed three patterns: "cloud", "zigzag", and "wave".
