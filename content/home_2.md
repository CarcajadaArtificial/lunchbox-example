### Button

Here’s the lowdown on our `<Button/>` component. It’s versatile, with five distinct types: default, disabled, error, panel, and transparent. Each type adapts visually depending on whether it’s on a `<Panel/>` or a regular background.

The default uses our “personality” color, standing out in any setting. The disabled is slightly opaque, indicating it’s inactive. The error is a striking red, demanding attention. The panel type blends with the `<Panel/>` background, looking like a part of it, or stands out on a regular background. The transparent button, with no background of its own, subtly changes on hover and active states based on its parent.

Buttons also come in two sizes: large and compact, fitting seamlessly into any layout. Their interaction with `<Panel/>`components enhances the design, creating a dynamic, responsive interface.
