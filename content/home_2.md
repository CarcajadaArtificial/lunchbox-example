## Button

Our `<Button/>` component is versatile, with five types: default, disabled,
error, panel, and transparent. Each type looks different depending on its
background. The default button uses our main color and stands out in any
setting. The disabled button is slightly opaque, indicating itâ€™s inactive. The
error button is red and noticeable. The panel button blends with a `<Panel/>` or
stands out on a regular background. The transparent button changes subtly on
hover and active states. Buttons come in two sizes: large and compact, fitting
into any layout.
