``Hello ( ´ ω ` )ノﾞ`` Thanks for stopping by and showing interest! This site
serves as a showcase for all the components available in the Lunchbox library,
each displayed with configurable attributes and brief explanations. This very
text is wrapped inside the `<Header/>` component, which is part of the "Page
Components" group we'll talk about later. Typically, the `<Header/>` is followed
by the `<Navigation/>` component. You can even configure the `<Header/>` to fill
most of the viewport's height by setting the boolean attribute "banner" to true.
