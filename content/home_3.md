## Input

The `<Input/>` component is for straightforward text input. It’s precise,
responsive, and fits into any form or interface. Together with the `<TextArea/>`
and `<Select/>` components, they have a standarized style, structure, and good
practices of other related HTMLElements like the `<label/>` element. The styles
of boolean inputs are also shared with the `<Fieldset/>` component, that uses
the `<legend/>` element. All these components are designed for clarity and ease
of use, ensuring users can enter and edit their information effortlessly.
They’re essential for creating an intuitive and efficient user experience.
