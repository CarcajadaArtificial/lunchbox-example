## InterObs

The `<InterObs/>` component is a powerful island component that leverages the
Intersection Observer API to monitor the visibility of its wrapped content
within the viewport. When the observed element enters the viewport, it can
trigger animations or execute callback functions, enhancing the interactivity
and dynamism of your web pages.
