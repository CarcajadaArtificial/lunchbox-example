## Panel

The `<Panel/>` component provides a contrasting background against the page's
main background, creating areas that stand out or are separated from the main
content. This background serves as the base aesthetic contrast for many
components like `<Header/>`, `<Footer/>`, `<Navigation/>`, `<Code/>`,
`<Button/>`, `<Card/>`, and `<Menu/>`. It's arguably one of the most important
components in the library.
