## Linkmap

The `<Linkmap/>` component creates a hierarchical tree of links. It utilizes
`<ul/>` elements nested within each other to form the tree structure, making it
easy to represent complex link hierarchies. Links within it can be empty,
appearing as unclickable sections to serve as placeholders or headings within
the tree. This component is useful for organizing and displaying links in a
clear, structured manner, enhancing navigation and user experience on the page.
